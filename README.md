# 🔗 chain-lab

Blockchain learning lab by [Turtleand](https://turtleand.com). Practical, experience-driven content about blockchain technology, DeFi, and the AI x crypto convergence.

**Live at:** [chain.turtleand.com](https://chain.turtleand.com) *(coming soon)*

## What This Is

Not a crypto news site. Not a trading guide. This is a builder's perspective on blockchain — learning by doing, documenting what works and what doesn't.

**Topics covered:**
- Chain fundamentals (explorers, tokenomics, L2 landscape)
- Ethereum ecosystem (privacy, account abstraction, Optimism/Base)
- DeFi in practice (stablecoins, DEX routing, risk frameworks)
- AI x Blockchain (agent wallets, payments, private inference)
- Multi-chain (Solana, Bitcoin L2s)
